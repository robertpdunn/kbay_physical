#odd numbers are bleached colony of paired colonies


#Fit GAMs to each of the 4 predictor variables for the full time series (each time series has different duration). 
#Fit GAMS to each of the 2 responses ( health scores and zoox.), need to account for initial bleaching status, reef, species, colony?

#subset data to correspond to each of the bleaching intervals
#Intervals are: Oct. 24, 2014-end of Jan. 31 2015 and Aug/Sept 2015- Jan 2016
#Extract bins around each of the sampling time points
